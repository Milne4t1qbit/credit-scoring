# credit-scoring
Python Package Development and Version Control for the Team Finance Credit Scoring Project

Slack:       #team-finance-credit
Jira:        CSAC    stands for credit scoring and classification, since "CS" was a little too overloaded :)
Confluence:  Search for credit scoring

The original repo was a private repo although owned by 1QBit:  Milne4t1qbit/credit-scoring, from the early days of 1QBit.
The code was moved to a generic company repo in 2018: PY_Applications.repo/1QBit.DWaveFinApplications/CreditScoringAndClassification

The original repo is now used for training purposes.

Have a pleasant day.
